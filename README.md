# Animal-descriptions
This repository consists of two different homework assignments with similar goals of creating classes to log information about zoo animals.

#Part 1


The first section creates animal classes that store the sound an animal makes and an interesting fact or statement about the animal. The example creates objects from these classes and then outputs the individual animals' name, age, sound they make, and fact about them, as if it were on a display at a zoo. This is the example output from the lion, parrot, and elephant:

Name: Leo, Age: 5

Roar!

The lion is the king of the jungle


Name: Ellie, Age: 8

Trumpet!

Elephants are the largest land animals


Name: Polly, Age: 2

Squawk!

Parrots can mimic human speech


Part 2

The second section simulates an information center for an arbitrary pet hotel. It takes animals as data points along with each idividual animal's name, species, age, cost of boarding, sound they make, description of how they eat, description of their favorite trick, and how they go to sleep. The method then outputs all of the information on each animal in the shelter. This is the example output for a dog, a cat, and a parrot.


Dog (Buddy, Age 3)

Buddy barks loudly!

Buddy eats kibble happily.

Buddy performs a trained trick and rolls over

Buddy fetches a toy

Buddy goes to sleep.


Cat (Misty, Age 2)

Misty meows softly

Misty eats kibble with elegance

Misty engages in her special behavior and scratches the post

Misty curls up and goes to sleep


Parrot (Polly, Age 5)

Polly squawks brightly

Polly pecks at the kibble

Polly performs her special behavior: mimics a phrase

Polly tucks her head and goes to sleep
